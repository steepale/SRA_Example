# Submitting via SRA Submission Portal Wizard
1. Log in to the SRA Submission Portal Wizard.
2. Create new SRA submission (click on the button New submission).
3. Register your project (Bioproject) and biological samples (Biosamples) if you did not register them before at BioProject and BioSample databases, respectively, or in other Submission Portal Wizards. Please refer to the SRA-specific guidelines here.
4. Submit SRA metadata - information that will link your project, samples/experiments and file names. Please refer to the SRA Metadata Overview.
5. Upload sequence data files. Please refer to SRA File Upload help.

### 2. Project Type

## Project data type: 
# Raw sequence reads

## Sample score:
# Choices:
Monoisolate: a single animal, cultured cell-line, inbred population (or possibly a heterogeneous population when a single genome assemby is generated from the pooled sample; not preferred).
Multiisolate: multiple individuals, a population (representative of a species). To be used for variation or other sequence comparison projects, not when multiple genomes will be annotated. Make separate monoisolate projects when more than one genome will be annotated.
Multi-species: sample represents multiple species.
Environment: the species content of the sample is not known.
Synthetic: the sample is synthetically created by a machine.
Other: specify the sample scope that was used.
# Multiisolate was chosen

### 3. Target

## Organism name:
# Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2

# Need to determine the number of sequences

## Description:
# These data are field isolates of Marek’s disease virus (Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2) collected primarily within the United States. Five samples underwent whole genome sequencing (same names contain ‘WGS’) and the remainder underwent targeted DNA sequencing.

### 4. General Info
